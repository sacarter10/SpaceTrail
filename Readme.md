TODO: 
* When searching dead ship -- find more things w/ more crew members, but risk death
* QuickStart button
* use radio buttons instead of text input where possible -- requires less error checking!
* Better error checking / messaging for invalid inputs
* compile everything during deployment -- snap-ci?
* Save game state in localStorage across browser sessions
* does #planets div really need to be square? adds weird padding to bottom of page
